**********************
REST API Specification
**********************

This document is a complete specification of Sawtooth Lake's REST API,
built from the official `OpenAPI <http://swagger.io/specification/>`_
formatted YAML specification, which can be found on the
`Sawtooth Lake Github <https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/rest_api/sawtooth_rest_api/openapi.yaml>`_.

.. note::
  This specification has not been fully implemented, and
  at this point should be considered a roadmap rather than a
  reference for usage. Until complete, many of the endpoints
  may not work, or may behave differently than documented.
